# Overview

<div style={{textAlign: 'center', padding: 30}}>

A KSP library that processes annotations and generates code that uses Official Jetpack Compose Navigation under the hood. It hides the complex, non-type-safe and boilerplate code you would have to write otherwise.  
No need to learn a whole new framework to navigate - most APIs are either the same as with the Jetpack Components or inspired by them.

## Main features

- Typesafe navigation arguments
- Simple but configurable navigation graphs setup
- Navigating back with a result in a simple and type-safe way
- Getting the navigation arguments from the `SavedStateHandle` (useful in ViewModels) and `NavBackStackEntry` in a type-safe way
- Navigation animations
- Destination wrappers to allow reusing Compose logic on multiple screens
- Bottom sheet destinations
- Easy deep linking to screens
- All you can do with Official Jetpack Compose Navigation but in a simpler safer way!

## Community
Please join the community at Kotlin slack channel: [#compose-destinations](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/archives/C06CS4UCQ10)  
Ask questions, suggest improvements, or anything else related to the library.


## Basic Usage

### 1. Annotate your screen Composables with `@Destination<RootGraph>`

```kotlin
@Destination<RootGraph> // sets this as a destination of the "root" nav graph
@Composable
fun ProfileScreen() { /*...*/ }
```

### 2. Add navigation arguments to the function declaration
`Parcelable`, `Serializable`, `Enum` types and classes annotated with [`@kotlinx.serialization.Serializable`](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) (as well as `Array`s and `ArrayList`s of these) are allowed with no additional setup!  
Besides, you can make any type a navigation argument type with a [one-time simple setup](arguments/navigation-arguments#custom-navigation-argument-types).

```kotlin
@Destination<RootGraph>
@Composable
fun ProfileScreen(
   id: Int, // <-- required navigation argument
   groupName: String?, // <-- optional navigation argument
   isOwnUser: Boolean = false // <-- optional navigation argument
) { /*...*/ }
```

:::info

There is an alternative way to define the destination arguments in case you don't need to use them
inside the Composable (as is likely the case when using ViewModel). Read more [here](arguments/navigation-arguments#destination-navigation-arguments).

:::

### 3. Build the project
Or run ksp task (example: `./gradlew kspDebugKotlin`), to generate all the Destinations. With the above annotated composable, a `ProfileScreenDestination` file would be generated (that we'll use in step 4).

### 4. Use the generated Destination invoke method to navigate to it
It will have the correct typed arguments.

```kotlin
@Destination<RootGraph>(start = true) // sets this as the start destination of the "root" nav graph
@Composable
fun HomeScreen(
   navigator: DestinationsNavigator
) {
   /*...*/
   navigator.navigate(ProfileScreenDestination(id = 7, groupName = "Kotlin programmers"))
}
```
:::note

DestinationsNavigator is a wrapper interface to NavController that if declared as a parameter, will be provided by the library. NavController can also be provided in the exact same way, but it ties your composables to a specific implementation which will make it harder to test and preview. Read more [here](navigation/basics/#destinationsnavigator-vs-navcontroller)

:::

### 5. Finally, add the NavHost call

```kotlin
DestinationsNavHost(navGraph = NavGraphs.root)
```

:::info

`NavGraphs` is a generated file that contains all navigation graphs. 
`root` here corresponds to the `<RootGraph>` we used in the above examples.
You're also able to [create your own navigation graph annotations](defining-navgraphs) to use instead of `<RootGraph>`.

:::

This call adds all annotated Composable functions as destinations of the Navigation Host.

That's it! No need to worry about routes, NavTypes, bundles and strings. All that redundant and error-prone code gets generated for you.
